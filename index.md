Hi! I am Atharva. Welcome to my blog. Here I write about all the new things I learn, because If I don't I'll forget and it also helps understand things better.
I am really passionate about systems.

I currently work in Microsoft in the Azure Frontdoor Team which is Microsoft's CDN.

Apart from work I love playing cricket, swimming and playing Piano.
